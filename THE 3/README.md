    There is 1 task to be solved in 12 days in this take home exam.
    You will implement your solutions in the3.cpp file.
    You are free to add other functions to the3.cpp. 
    Do not change the first line of the3.cpp,which is #include "the3.h"
    Do not include any other library or write include anywhere in your lab3.cpp file (not even in comments)
    <iostream>, <vector>, <numeric>, <utility> , <climits> are included for your convenience.

    You are given a test.cpp file to run and debug your work. You can and you are encouraged to modify this file to add different test cases.
    Clicking run or debug will compile your solutions with test.cpp file.
    evaluate will be done after the deadline. You will not be able to evaluate yourself.


    The system have the following limits:
        a maximum execution time of 1 minute
        a 256 MB maximum memory limit
        a stack size of 64 MB for function calls (ie. recursive solutions)


    Each task has a complexity constraint explained in respective sections.
    Solutions with longer running times will be heavily penalized. You will receive 20% of the total grade.


    If you are sure that your solution works in the expected complexity constrains but your evaluation fails due to limits in the lab environment, the constant factors may be the problem. 
    If your solution is correct, the time and memory limits may be adjusted to accept your solution after the lab. Please send an email if that is the case for you.
